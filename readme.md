# CTC16
The homepage for [CTC16 - Air Quality 2 event](https://codethecity.org/hack-weekends/code-the-city-16-air-quality-2/) 8th/9th June 2019 at the University of Aberdeen.

### Sponsors made it happen
We had a number of sponsors for the event.
[FortyTwo Studio](https://www.fortytwo.studio) covered food for our 28 (Saturday) and 24 (Sunday) hungry participants.
[Converged Communication Solutions](https://www.converged.co.uk) and [Codify](https://www.codify.ltd.uk) each paid for 10 air quality sensors for us to build and deploy in the city.

Please also take a look at some of the ideas suggested so far on our [Ideas platform](http://ideas.codethecity.co.uk/codethecity/ctc16-air-quality-2)
